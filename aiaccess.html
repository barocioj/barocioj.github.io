  <p>Since neurodivergent is often diagnosed at a young age, it can go largely unnoticed and can affect young children in their education. Due to this, neurodivergent children often are not on an even playing field with their peers.</p>

  <p>Artificial Intelligence software like Innervoice help neurodivergent students by giving them extra resources to help users better form connections between objects and language. Will there once be a future where programs like this are just a part of our daily lives, even if its outside of the education or workplace environment.</p>

  <p>Artificial Intelligence software can help adults just as easily as the youth. Specifically in the workplace, or learning environments AI powered tools can be used to analyze large amounts of text and summarize it so it is easier to digest.</p>

  <p>Outside the field of education, Artificial intelligence can improve neurodivergent individuals' accessibility to jobs. This is because compared to their neurotypical counterparts, they excel in skills and jobs that require technologically inclined and detail oriented workers. If in a capitalist societies, efficiency and keeping cost low, hy do you think it has taken companies so long to realize this.</p>

Additionally, with the advent of Artificial Intelligence, there are now more opportunities to effectively use the talent of neurodivergent workers. Doing this results in a healthier, accessible, more efficient workplace.</strong></p>

  <p>Do you believe that business have direct influence to address these gaps and inequalities in order to build a better working wold and better working work environment?</p>

  <p>There is a common belief that Artificial Intelligence is going to ‘take over’ peoples jobs. Do you believe this to be true, or are you more keen with the article. That is to say that Artificla Intelligence is now creating more unique opportunities and creating more skilled workers.</p>
