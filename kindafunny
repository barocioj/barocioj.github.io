  <p><strong>Video games are becoming increasingly more complex in terms of not only their gameplay, but it also has not seen development in including black hairstyles.</strong></p>

  <p>For a medium that is supposed to be an extension of the player in a virtual world, the lack of accurate hairstyles destroys that notion.</p>

  <p>In the case of some games, the lack of diverse hairstyles can be tied to where the games are developed. Specifically in Japan where there is not much diversity among development teams.</p>

  <p>Black hairstyles have unfortunately been a part of many racist incidents in the past.</p>

  <p>Even when game developers try to include more diverse hair, a lack of thorough reviews is shown. This is to say that they almost do the bare minimum.</p>

  <p>Many of these problems with inclusion are brushed aside by pointing out that the games were made for different audiences.</p>

  <p>A lot of the lack of diversity when it comes to black hairstyles in video games, comes from the lack of information that game developers have on it.</p>

  <p>In a character select screen, have you ever felt like you were not able to fully express yourself within the game?</p>

  <p>Do you believe that a lot of these developers should look to sports games on diverse hairstyles, as creating models for each individual player has ultimately lead to a greater amount of diversity?</p>

  <p>Why do you think that these large companies, especially those not based in the United States, but with still huge markets here, have not made any changes to their character designs?</p>

  <p>Do you think this issue speaks to the lack of diversity in the gaming world in general?</p>

  <p>How long do you think it'll take for most games to adapt to a more inclusive environment?</p>
