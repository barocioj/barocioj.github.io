<p> Do you think that the criticism Nicki Washington got is valid, or do they clearly demonstrate the problem at SIGCSE?</p>

<p>Are the problems that are present at SIGCSE applicable to the CS world in general, as in do these behaviors and patterns exist elsewhere?</p>

<p><strong>While SIGCSE has made efforts to combat the problems outlined by Dr. Nicki Washington, there is still blatant elitistm and biases to work,  especially to  the work that are written by BIPOC.</strong></p>

<p>What actions can be taken by the SIGCSE to decrease the prevalence of the issues that Nicki Washington stated, will these be effective?</p>

<p>The elitism present at SIGCSE and the greater Computer Science community are holding it back both in terms of diversity and inclusion as well as the introduction of new ideas.</p>

<p>The lack of diversity in both the people at SIGCSE and the ideas presented are both effects of the elitist attitudes of the attendees there.</p>

<p>Since elitism and lack of diversity have been prevalent for so long at SIGSE, problematic reviews go forward unchallenged and supported by the committee.</p>

<p>Have you ever felt discriminated against or undervalued in the CS department in any capacity?</p>

<p>Why are the reviews at SIGCSE reviewed, or what is the process to get a reviewer's comments supervised and looked over?</p>

<p>Why are new ideas, or ideas that go “against the grain” looked down upon and reviewed more negatively than “safe” ideas?</p>

<p>The reviewers at SIGCSE seem to nitpick or critique very heavily ideas by people who are “less than them”. AKA people without PHD’s or even people of color. </p>

<p>A lot of the comments by reviewers at SIGCSE are contradictory to the guidelines and rules set at SIGCSE and only serve to maintain their elitist attitudes.</p>

<p>Do you think as it currently is, that SIGSCE is beneficial to the Computer Science community?</p>
