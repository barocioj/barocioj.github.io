  <p> Jesus Barocio Discussion </p>
  <p> Reading this article was very fascinating to me, this is honestly the first time that I have ever heard wage theft as a term. I think that the article does a really From what I understand, in the article all of the data was taken from and analyzed front eh same organization that wrote the article. First, looking through the article I do not know what the survey contained, or how they were able to gather all of the graphical data through a survey, especially regarding wage theft. My guess is that it was a very comprehensive survey and the people knew what it was going to be used for then there are not any ethical red flags that I can see. The only thing that concerns me is that almost all of the data comes from this one survey, and the article does not take any liberties to gather data from other sources. In terms of use, I cannot really see an issue, they are not really upfront with what the survey really was though. It only concerns me with the fact that they were able to get so much information out of this survey and makes me wonder if the people who took it know that it was going to be used for all of this information. </p>
